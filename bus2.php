          <p> Specifications of a bus often include its dimensions, seating capacity, engine type, and fuel efficiency. Standard buses are around 12 meters (40 feet) long, with articulated models extending up to 18 meters (60 feet). They can seat between 40 to 80 passengers, depending on the design and configuration. Modern buses are equipped with engines that comply with stringent emission standards, running on diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), electricity, or hybrid systems. Additional features might include low-floor designs for accessibility, advanced safety systems, air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and real-time location tracking for enhanced passenger convenience.</p>
